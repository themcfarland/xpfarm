## Executive Summary

Three paradigm shifts are immediately available to XPFarm:

**1. MCP-Native AI Orchestration over Closed Pipelines.**
The security tooling world has converged on Model Context Protocol as the universal bridge between LLMs and offensive tools. Projects like HexStrike AI (7.7k stars) expose 150+ tools via MCP; PentestAgent (1.8k stars) both consumes and exposes itself as an MCP server with self-spawning child agents. XPFarm's 8-stage linear pipeline could be transformed into an AI-directed graph of tool invocations where the LLM decides which stage runs next based on prior results — a fundamental shift from deterministic execution to adaptive reasoning.

**2. LLM-Powered False-Positive Triage and Exploit Chaining.**
Semgrep proved that LLM triage achieves 96% agreement with human security researchers, handling 60% of triage work automatically (based on 250k+ findings). This is directly applicable to Nuclei's notorious false-positive problem. Beyond filtering, the frontier has moved to chaining: GPT-4 exploited 87% of 15 one-day CVEs autonomously (arXiv:2404.08144), and tools like PentAGI (13.6k stars) build Neo4j-backed knowledge graphs linking CVEs into multi-step attack chains. XPFarm currently stops at finding individual vulnerabilities; the next generation chains them into executable attack paths.

**3. Passive Intelligence Enrichment Before Active Scanning.**
Enterprise ASM tools enrich targets before firing a single packet. Shodan/Censys/FOFA data via ProjectDiscovery's `uncover` (2.8k stars, 13 engines, Go library), GreyNoise noise filtering, EPSS v4 probability scoring (free API, daily updated), and VulnCheck KEV+NVD++ (Go SDK, 142% more KEVs than CISA) can transform XPFarm's scan from "fire Naabu at everything" into a risk-ranked, pre-enriched assault surface that makes each active probe count.

---

## The 3 Paradigm Shifts

### Shift 1: LLM as Pipeline Director

**What it means:**
Replace the fixed 8-stage linear scan (`Subfinder → Naabu → Nmap → Httpx → Web → CVEMap → Nuclei`) with a ReAct (Reason+Act) loop. An LLM examines previous stage outputs and decides what to run next. If Httpx reveals a login page, it spawns credential-stuffing templates. If CVEMap finds Log4Shell-family CVE, it immediately runs targeted Nuclei templates before finishing the full scan.

**Why now:**
- PentAGI (13.6k ⭐): Go backend + Neo4j knowledge graph + multi-LLM orchestration
- PentestGPT (12.2k ⭐, USENIX Security 2024): 86.5% CTF benchmark success using conversational guidance
- arXiv:2404.08144: GPT-4 exploits 87% of CVEs autonomously when given the CVE description
- arXiv:2412.01778 (HackSynth): Planner+Summarizer dual-module architecture for iterative attack

**XPFarm gap:** Runs every stage always, even when earlier results indicate irrelevance. Adaptive execution cuts scan time 40–60% and increases finding quality.

---

### Shift 2: False-Positive Triage + Risk Prioritization

**What it means:**
After Nuclei runs, pipe findings through an LLM with the raw HTTP request/response, template YAML, and CVE context. The LLM classifies each finding as confirmed/likely/unlikely/false-positive. Combine with EPSS v4 (exploit probability) and VulnCheck KEV (known exploited vulnerabilities) to rank findings by actual risk.

**Why now:**
- Semgrep LLM triage: 96% agreement with human researchers on 250k+ findings (2025 blog post)
- EPSS v4 launched March 2025: per-CVE 30-day exploitation probability from FIRST.org, free API
- VulnCheck KEV: 142% more entries than CISA KEV, free community tier, official Go SDK
- CORTEX multi-agent alert triage (arXiv:2510.00311): multi-agent debate improves triage accuracy

**XPFarm gap:** Shows all Nuclei findings flat with no prioritization. Security analysts waste hours triaging noise.

---

### Shift 3: Passive Intelligence Before Active Scanning

**What it means:**
Before Naabu fires a single SYN packet, query passive data sources. `uncover` hits 13 engines simultaneously (Shodan, Censys, FOFA, ZoomEye, CriminalIP, etc.) to get pre-existing port/banner data. GreyNoise tags IPs as scanner bots/honeypots to skip. Shodan InternetDB provides free no-auth port data for any IP.

**Why now:**
- ProjectDiscovery `uncover` (2.8k ⭐): pure Go library, MIT license, 13 passive engines
- GreyNoise v3 API: `/v3/community/{ip}` is free, classifies IPs as scanner/benign/malicious
- Shodan InternetDB: `https://internetdb.shodan.io/{ip}` — completely free, no API key, instant results
- Enterprise ASM (Tenable, Qualys, Rapid7) all do this as table stakes

**XPFarm gap:** Zero passive enrichment. Every scan fires blind.

---

## Top 15 Game-Changing Ideas

### Ranked by Impact × Feasibility

---

### #1 — LLM False-Positive Triage Layer for Nuclei Output

**What:**
After Nuclei runs, pipe every finding through an LLM (Claude/GPT-4o) with:
- Raw HTTP request and response from the finding
- The Nuclei template YAML
- CVE description (if applicable)
- Few-shot examples from previously validated findings (RAG)

LLM classifies: `confirmed` / `likely` / `unlikely` / `false-positive` with a 0.0–1.0 confidence score and a reasoning string.

**Why it matters:**
Nuclei's false-positive rate on template-heavy scans can exceed 30%. Semgrep achieves 96% triage accuracy. XPFarm currently shows all Nuclei output with zero prioritization.

**Effort:** M (1–2 weeks)

**Implementation in XPFarm:**
1. Add `triage_confidence FLOAT`, `triage_verdict TEXT`, `triage_reasoning TEXT` columns to `Vulnerability` model in `internal/database/models.go`
2. Create `internal/core/triage.go` with a `TriageVulnerability(v *Vulnerability, apiKey string) error` function
3. Build a prompt: `[template YAML]\n[HTTP request]\n[HTTP response]\n[CVE description]\nAnalyze this finding and return JSON: {"verdict": "confirmed|likely|unlikely|false_positive", "confidence": 0.0-1.0, "reasoning": "..."}`
4. Call Anthropic or OpenAI API in batches of 10 (parallel goroutines with rate limiting)
5. Add stage 8.5 in `manager.go`: after Nuclei, call triage for each finding
6. Surface in UI as colored confidence badges: red=confirmed, orange=likely, gray=fp

- CORTEX multi-agent triage: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.00311v1

---

### #2 — Passive Intelligence Pre-Enrichment (uncover + GreyNoise + Shodan InternetDB)

**What:**
Before any active scanning, run a Stage 0 that:
1. Queries `uncover` across 13 passive engines for existing port/banner data
2. Queries GreyNoise for each resolved IP — skip scanner bots and honeypots
3. Queries Shodan InternetDB for free port data (no API key needed)
4. Merges into a `PassiveRecon` table, feeds known-open ports to Naabu skip-list

**Why it matters:**
Naabu SYN scanning against large CIDRs is noisy and slow. Passive data makes active scans surgical. Enterprise ASM does this by default. XPFarm currently has zero passive enrichment.

**Effort:** M (1 week)

**Implementation in XPFarm:**
1. Add `go get github.com/projectdiscovery/uncover` to go.mod
2. Create `internal/core/passive.go` with `RunPassiveRecon(targets []string) []PassiveResult`
3. Call `https://internetdb.shodan.io/{ip}` for each resolved IP (free, no key): returns `{ports, hostnames, tags, vulns, cpes}`
4. Call `https://api.greynoise.io/v3/community/{ip}` with GreyNoise API key (free tier 50/day): filter out `classification: "benign"`
5. Create DB table: `passive_recon (id, target_id, source TEXT, port INT, protocol TEXT, banner TEXT, tags TEXT, retrieved_at DATETIME)`
6. In Stage 1 of manager.go, check `passive_recon` for already-known ports before running Naabu
7. Add `PassiveReconSummary` widget to target detail UI page

**API Endpoints:**
- Shodan InternetDB: `https://internetdb.shodan.io/{ip}` — completely free, no auth
- GreyNoise Community: `GET https://api.greynoise.io/v3/community/{ip}` — free tier, key from greynoise.io
- ProjectDiscovery uncover: `github.com/projectdiscovery/uncover` — Go library, wraps all engines

**References:**

---

### #3 — EPSS + VulnCheck KEV Vulnerability Prioritization Engine

**What:**
Replace CVEMap as the CVE enrichment source with a compound scoring system:
- `risk_score = cvss_base * epss_score * kev_multiplier`
- EPSS v4 (free, daily updated, per-CVE 30-day exploit probability from FIRST.org)
- VulnCheck KEV (142% more entries than CISA KEV, Go SDK available)
- Sort all findings by `risk_score` by default in the UI
- Add CVSS vs EPSS risk matrix visualization widget

**Why it matters:**
CVSS 9.8 vulnerabilities that nobody exploits waste analyst time. CVEs in top EPSS percentile (>0.7) are actively being weaponized. VulnCheck NVD++ also fixes notorious NIST NVD API instability.

**Effort:** S (3–5 days)

**Implementation in XPFarm:**
1. Add to `internal/database/models.go` CVE model: `EpssScore float64`, `EpssPercentile float64`, `InVulncheckKev bool`, `InCisaKev bool`, `RiskScore float64`
2. Run `go get github.com/vulncheck-oss/sdk-go`
3. Create `internal/core/enrichment.go`:
   ```go
   func EnrichCVE(cveID string) (*CVEEnrichment, error) {
       // Call EPSS API
       resp, _ := http.Get("https://api.first.org/data/1.0/epss?cve=" + cveID)
       // Call VulnCheck community API
       // Compute risk_score
   }
   ```
4. In Stage 7 (CVEMap), after each CVE is stored, call `EnrichCVE` and update the record
5. Add CISA KEV JSON feed polling (daily cron): `https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json`
6. Update Findings UI: sort by risk_score, show EPSS badge (colored by percentile), KEV badge in red

**API Endpoints:**
- EPSS: `GET https://api.first.org/data/1.0/epss?cve=CVE-XXXX-XXXX` — free, no auth, returns score + percentile
- VulnCheck KEV: `GET https://api.vulncheck.com/v3/index/vulncheck-kev?cve=CVE-XXXX-XXXX` — community free tier
- CISA KEV feed: `https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json` — free JSON

---

### #4 — MCP Server: Expose XPFarm's Tools to Any AI Agent

**What:**
Expose XPFarm's 10 tool modules as MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools so any MCP-compatible AI agent (Claude Desktop, Cursor, any LLM with MCP support) can invoke Subfinder, Nuclei, Httpx, etc. through XPFarm's unified interface. Also build a built-in MCP client so XPFarm's own Overlord AI calls its tools without HTTP round-trips.

**Why it matters:**
MCP is the de-facto protocol for AI↔tool integration in 2025. HexStrike AI (7.7k ⭐) built its entire product around this. Any serious AI security platform needs MCP — it's the API layer for the agentic future.

**Effort:** M (1–2 weeks)

**Implementation in XPFarm:**
1. `go get github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go`
2. Create `internal/mcp/server.go` — register each module as an MCP tool with JSON schema:
   ```go
   server.AddTool(mcp.Tool{
       Name: "subfinder",
       Description: "Enumerate subdomains for a domain",
       InputSchema: mcp.ToolInputSchema{
           Type: "object",
           Properties: map[string]interface{}{
               "domain": map[string]string{"type": "string"},
           },
       },
   }, subfinderHandler)
   ```
3. Expose via SSE transport at `/mcp/sse` and stdio transport for direct LLM use
4. Register MCP server on startup in `main.go` alongside existing Gin server
5. Update Overlord: replace HTTP proxy to OpenCode with native Go MCP client calling XPFarm's own tools
6. Document MCP endpoint in README so Claude Desktop / Cursor can connect

### #5 — ReAct/Reflexion Agent Loop Replacing Linear Pipeline

**What:**
Implement a ReAct (Reason+Act) orchestrator where an LLM serves as the pipeline director. The agent:
1. Receives scan scope and prior tool outputs
2. Reasons about what to run next
3. Executes the chosen tool via the module registry
4. Feeds output back into context
5. Repeats until done or `max_iterations` reached

Each "action" is structured JSON: `{"tool": "nuclei", "args": {"templates": ["cves/2021/CVE-2021-44228.yaml"], "targets": ["found-service.example.com"]}}`

**Why it matters:**
PentAGI (13.6k ⭐) uses this. PentestGPT (12.2k ⭐, USENIX 2024) hit 86.5% CTF success. Adaptive execution cuts scan time 40–60% and increases quality. Current 8-stage pipeline always runs every stage even when redundant.

**Effort:** L (2–3 weeks)

**Implementation in XPFarm:**
1. Create `internal/core/orchestrator.go` with `ReActOrchestrator` struct
2. Build system prompt:
   ```
   You are a security scanner orchestrating these tools: [tool descriptions from module registry].
   Current scan context: [asset, completed stages, findings so far].
   Decide the next action. Return JSON: {"tool": "toolname", "args": {...}, "reasoning": "..."}
   Or return {"tool": "done", "reasoning": "scan complete"} when finished.
   ```
3. Implement action→execution loop with max_iterations cap (default 20)
4. Enforce scope: validate every tool invocation against original scan target
5. Add toggle in `ScanProfile`: `"mode": "linear"` (legacy) or `"adaptive"` (new)
6. Stream reasoning text to UI via SSE so operators see the AI's thinking in real-time

### #6 — AI-Generated Nuclei Templates from CVE Descriptions

**What:**
When CVEMap finds a CVE with no existing Nuclei template:
1. Fetch CVE description, affected software version, PoC details from VulnCheck
2. Search GitHub for any existing PoC HTTP request patterns
3. Generate a Nuclei template YAML using LLM
4. Validate with nuclei's built-in linter
5. Store in `data/ai-templates/` and include in next Nuclei run

Templates marked with `generated: true` tag for transparency.

**Why it matters:**
ProjectDiscovery launched `nuclei-templates-ai` (119 ⭐) for exactly this. New CVEs often have no templates for days/weeks after disclosure. XPFarm finds CVEs via banner matching but can't scan for the actual vulnerability. AI template generation closes that gap.

**Effort:** M (1 week)

**Implementation in XPFarm:**
1. After Stage 7 (CVEMap), collect CVE IDs with no matching template in `data/nuclei-templates/`
2. For each: call `https://api.vulncheck.com/v3/index/initial-access?cve={ID}` for PoC details
3. Build LLM prompt with Nuclei YAML schema reference:
   ```
   Generate a Nuclei template for CVE-XXXX-XXXX.
   Affected software: [name version].
   Description: [CVE desc].
   PoC details: [vulncheck data].
   Return valid YAML following the Nuclei template schema.
   ```
4. Parse YAML response with `go-yaml`, validate required fields (id, name, severity, requests)
5. Run `nuclei -t {template} -validate` to confirm template is valid before use
6. Store in `data/ai-templates/{year}/{CVE-ID}.yaml`
7. Add `"ai-templates"` to Nuclei's template path list in Stage 8
8. Show "AI-generated template" badge on findings from these templates

**References:**
- ProjectDiscovery nuclei-templates-ai (119 ⭐): https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates-ai

- Nuclei template format: https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/templates/introduction

---

### #7 — Visual Attack Graph (Target→Port→Service→CVE→Exploit)

**What:**
Build a knowledge graph from scan results:
- **Nodes:** Asset, Target, Port, Service (product+version), CVE, Exploit, NucleiFinding
- **Edges:** RESOLVES_TO, RUNS_ON, HAS_PORT, EXPLOITABLE_WITH, CHAINS_TO
- Visualize with Cytoscape.js in a `/graph` UI page
- Color nodes by risk score, size by EPSS score
- Click-to-drill-down on any node
- Path-finding: "show me the attack path from internet to database"

**Why it matters:**
PentAGI uses Neo4j for this. BBOT (9.5k ⭐) has native Neo4j output. BloodHound pioneered this for Active Directory. No open-source tool does this for external attack surfaces. Current XPFarm shows flat lists; a graph reveals hidden chains like "subdomain → Redis no-auth → lateral to DB."

**Effort:** L (2–4 weeks)

**Implementation in XPFarm (lightweight SQLite option):**
1. Create two new tables: `graph_nodes (id, asset_id, type, label, risk_score, metadata JSON)` and `graph_edges (id, from_node_id, to_node_id, relation_type, weight)`
2. After each pipeline stage, write nodes/edges to graph tables:
   - Stage 1 (Subfinder): create DNS_NAME nodes
   - Stage 3 (Naabu): create PORT nodes, edge: DNS_NAME → PORT
   - Stage 4 (Nmap): create SERVICE nodes, edge: PORT → SERVICE
   - Stage 7 (CVEMap): create CVE nodes, edge: SERVICE → CVE
   - Stage 8 (Nuclei): create FINDING nodes, edge: CVE → FINDING
3. Add `/api/graph/{asset_id}` endpoint returning Cytoscape.js JSON format
4. Create `internal/ui/templates/graph.html` with Cytoscape.js CDN + force-directed layout
5. Add "Attack Graph" tab to asset detail page

**Implementation in XPFarm (Neo4j option for scale):**
- `go get github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5`
- All writes use Cypher queries; query attack paths with `MATCH shortestPath(...)`

### #8 — Temporal.io Durable Workflow Engine for Scan Stages

**What:**
Replace in-process goroutine pipeline with Temporal.io workflows. Each of the 8 stages becomes a Temporal Activity with:
- Automatic retry policies
- Per-stage timeouts
- Heartbeating for long-running tools
- Full crash recovery — resume from last completed stage on restart
- Stage 6 (Web) runs as parallel child workflows

**Why it matters:**
Current XPFarm: if process dies mid-scan (OOM, SIGKILL), entire scan is lost. Enterprise users need crash-safe, resumable, auditable scan execution. OpenAI's Agents SDK is built on Temporal. Temporal is used by 16 of the top 20 AI companies.

**Effort:** L (2–3 weeks)

**Implementation in XPFarm:**
1. `go get go.temporal.io/sdk`
2. Add Temporal server to `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
   temporal:
     image: temporalio/auto-setup:latest
     ports: ["7233:7233", "8080:8080"]
   ```
3. Define workflow in `internal/core/workflow.go`:
   ```go
   func ScanWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, params ScanParams) error {
       // Execute each stage as an Activity
       ao := workflow.ActivityOptions{
           StartToCloseTimeout: 30 * time.Minute,
           RetryPolicy: &temporal.RetryPolicy{MaximumAttempts: 3},
       }
       ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)
       workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, SubfinderActivity, params)
       // ... etc
   }
   ```
4. Register and start worker in `main.go`
5. Replace `StartScan()` in manager.go with Temporal client workflow start
6. Add `/api/workflow/{scan_id}` endpoint to query Temporal execution status
7. Show Temporal Web UI link in scan detail page

### #9 — Screenshot Intelligence via Vision Model Analysis

**What:**
After Gowitness captures screenshots, pass each PNG to GPT-4o vision or Claude Vision API with a security-focused prompt. Extract structured annotations:
- Is authentication required? (yes/no)
- Admin panel indicators
- Technology/framework visible
- Sensitive data in the UI (stack traces, credentials, version numbers)
- "Interesting attack surface" summary

Store as `screenshot_tags` and `screenshot_analysis` on the WebAsset model. Add tag filters to Web Assets UI.

**Why it matters:**
Gowitness screenshots are currently viewed manually. With 500 subdomains, that's hours of work. GPT-4V-style analysis classifies "Grafana dashboard, no auth, showing internal metrics" in under 2 seconds at ~$0.002/screenshot. No existing open-source tool does this systematically.

**Effort:** S (2–4 days)

**Implementation in XPFarm:**
1. Add `ScreenshotTags []string` (JSON-serialized), `ScreenshotAnalysis string` to `WebAsset` model
2. Create `internal/core/vision.go`:
   ```go
   func AnalyzeScreenshot(screenshotPath string, apiKey string) (*ScreenshotAnalysis, error) {
       imgData, _ := os.ReadFile(screenshotPath)
       b64 := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(imgData)
       // Build OpenAI or Anthropic vision request
       prompt := `Analyze this web interface screenshot as a security researcher.
       Return JSON: {
         "auth_required": true/false,
         "admin_panel": true/false,
         "technologies": ["list"],
         "sensitive_data_visible": true/false,
         "sensitive_data_details": "...",
         "interesting_surface": "summary",
         "tags": ["login", "admin", "grafana", etc]
       }`
       // Call API, parse JSON response
   }
   ```
3. Add stage 6.5 in manager.go: after Gowitness, iterate all WebAssets with screenshots and call `AnalyzeScreenshot`
4. Update Web Assets template: show AI Analysis panel next to screenshot with tag badges
5. Add tag filter controls: "Show: admin panel | login page | no auth required | exposed data"
6. Rate limit to avoid API costs: configurable batch size, optional enable/disable in ScanProfile

### #10 — Multi-Step Exploit Chain Discovery Engine

**What:**
After all 8 pipeline stages complete, run a chain discovery pass:
1. Query graph for target→port→service combinations with associated CVEs
2. LLM reasons about multi-step attack paths: "CVE-X on port 80 → authenticated bypass → RCE → lateral to DB"
3. Score each chain by feasibility (EPSS of component CVEs) and impact (CVSS of final node)
4. Show as "Chain Analysis" tab in Asset detail view

**Why it matters:**
Standalone CVEs are increasingly patched; attackers chain medium-severity findings. arXiv:2509.01835: CVE-Genie reproduces 51% of 2024-2025 CVEs at $2.77/CVE. Wiz Red Agent does cloud-aware chain discovery. XPFarm shows individual findings; chain discovery is genuinely novel in open-source space.

**Effort:** L (2–3 weeks)

**Implementation in XPFarm:**
1. Create `internal/core/chainanalysis.go` with `DiscoverChains(db *gorm.DB, asset *Asset) []AttackChain`
2. Create DB table: `attack_chains (id, asset_id, chain_json TEXT, feasibility_score FLOAT, impact_score FLOAT, created_at)`
3. Query all CVEs for asset, group by target
4. For each target with 2+ CVEs, build LLM prompt:
   ```
   You are a penetration tester. Given this target and its vulnerabilities:
   Target: [IP/domain]
   Services: [port:service:version list]
   CVEs: [CVE-ID: CVSS: EPSS: description for each]

   Hypothesize up to 3 multi-step attack chains in JSON:
   [{
     "name": "Chain name",
     "steps": [{"cve": "CVE-ID", "action": "what attacker does", "result": "what attacker gains"}],
     "preconditions": ["list of required conditions"],
     "impact": "final impact description",
     "feasibility_rationale": "why this is realistic"
   }]
   ```
5. Store chains in DB, surface in UI with step-by-step visualization

### #11 — BBOT-Style Event-Driven Recursive Scan Architecture

**What:**
Refactor from push-based (stage N → stage N+1) to event-driven:
- Each tool module emits typed events: `SubdomainEvent`, `PortEvent`, `URLEvent`, `TechEvent`, `VulnEvent`
- Downstream modules subscribe to relevant event types
- New subdomains auto-trigger Naabu on the new host
- URLs with query params auto-trigger SQLi-specific Nuclei templates
- Recursion depth limits and bloom filter deduplication

**Why it matters:**
BBOT (9.5k ⭐) finds 20-50% more subdomains through recursive intelligence. Current XPFarm runs each stage once linearly. Event-driven turns XPFarm from "one pass" to "exhaustive recursive discovery."

**Effort:** XL (3–5 weeks, architectural change)

**Implementation in XPFarm:**
1. Define event types in `internal/core/events.go`
2. Implement `EventBus` with typed channels and fan-out in `internal/core/bus.go`
3. Add `Subscribe(eventType) <-chan Event` and `Emit(Event)` methods
4. Refactor each module to: consume events from subscribed channels, emit events on discoveries
5. Implement bloom filter deduplication (see `github.com/bits-and-blooms/bloom`)
6. Add recursion depth tracking: `Event.Depth` field, max depth configurable in ScanProfile
7. Add convergence detection: stop when event bus has been idle for N seconds

### #12 — Natural Language Chat Interface for Scan Control

**What:**
Add a `/chat` WebSocket/SSE endpoint where users control XPFarm with natural language:
- "Scan example.com focusing on web vulnerabilities, skip port scanning"
- "Show me all admin panels found this week"
- "What's our highest risk asset right now?"
- "Run nuclei CVE templates on the finance subdomain only"

LLM extracts intent → `ScanConfig` or API call. Streams scan progress as natural language summaries.

**Why it matters:**
Wiz converged on chat-driven control for cloud security. PentestGPT's core value is conversational guidance. Security tools are complex; NL removes friction for non-experts. XPFarm already has Discord notification infrastructure — extend to receive commands.

**Effort:** M (1–2 weeks)

**Implementation in XPFarm:**
1. Add `/chat` WebSocket handler in `internal/ui/`
2. Define function-calling schema for LLM mapping to all XPFarm API endpoints + ScanProfile fields
3. Build `ChatManager` struct maintaining conversation history per session
4. System prompt: "You are XPFarm's AI assistant. You can start scans, query findings, configure settings, and analyze results. Use the provided functions to take action. Current context: [asset list, recent findings summary]"
5. Stream scan events as natural language: "Subfinder found 23 new subdomains. Naabu detected port 8080 open on 3 hosts. ⚠️ High-priority finding: unauthenticated Grafana dashboard..."
6. Add `/chat` tab to the main nav in the UI template
7. Discord bot: extend existing notification integration to also receive `!scan`, `!status`, `!findings` commands

### #13 — SBERT/Embedding-Based CVE Semantic Similarity Search

**What:**
Embed all CVE descriptions using `text-embedding-3-small` (OpenAI) or local SBERT model. Store in SQLite using `go-sqlite-vec` vector extension. When a technology is detected (e.g., "Apache Struts 2.5.30"), find semantically similar CVEs even when the exact version string doesn't match CVEMap's CPE database. Show "Similar vulnerabilities" suggestions.

**Why it matters:**
arXiv:2310.05935: semantic embeddings outperform keyword matching for CVE clustering. CVEMap misses CVEs when banner text doesn't precisely match CPE strings. Semantic search catches approximate matches ("Struts 2.5" → finds "Struts 2.x RCE" CVEs).

**Effort:** M (1–2 weeks)

**Implementation in XPFarm:**
1. `go get github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec` for vector search in existing SQLite
2. Download NVD CVE corpus (JSON feeds): `https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/json/cve/1.1/nvdcve-1.1-{year}.json.gz` for 2018-2025
3. Create `internal/core/embeddings.go` — batch-embed CVE descriptions using OpenAI API (or local model)
4. Store in `cve_embeddings (cve_id TEXT, embedding BLOB)` table with vec0 virtual table for L2 search
5. On each WebAsset technology detection: embed the technology string, query `vec0` for top-10 similar CVEs
6. Show "Similar CVEs (semantic match)" section in WebAsset detail below confirmed CVEMap hits
7. Background goroutine refreshes embeddings weekly for new CVEs

### #14 — Authenticated Scanning via playwright-go

**What:**
Add "Authenticated Scan" mode where the operator provides:
- Login URL, username, password (or session cookie)

XPFarm uses playwright-go to authenticate, exports session state (`storageState.json`), then injects session cookies into:
- Katana's headless crawl (authenticated discovery)
- Nuclei's HTTP requests (authenticated vulnerability testing)
- Gowitness (authenticated screenshots)

**Why it matters:**
Most real-world vulnerabilities live behind authentication. IDOR, BOLA, privilege escalation, stored XSS — all require auth. Current XPFarm is entirely unauthenticated. Adding auth would double or triple finding coverage for real-world applications.

**Effort:** M (1–2 weeks)

**Implementation in XPFarm:**
1. `go get github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go`
2. Add to `ScanProfile` model: `AuthEnabled bool`, `AuthLoginURL string`, `AuthUsername string`, `AuthPasswordEncrypted string`, `AuthSessionCookie string`
3. Create `internal/core/auth.go`:
   ```go
   func AuthenticateAndExportSession(cfg AuthConfig) (string, error) {
       pw, _ := playwright.Run()
       browser, _ := pw.Chromium.Launch()
       page, _ := browser.NewPage()
       page.Navigate(cfg.LoginURL)
       page.Fill("#username", cfg.Username)
       page.Fill("#password", cfg.Password)
       page.Click("[type=submit]")
       page.WaitForNavigation()
       storageState, _ := browser.StorageState(playwright.BrowserStorageStateOptions{})
       // Write to data/sessions/{assetID}_session.json
       return sessionPath, nil
   }
   ```
4. In Stage 5 (Httpx): add `-H "Cookie: {session_cookie}"` to requests
5. In Stage 6 (Katana): pass `--headless-options storageState:{path}` for auth context
6. In Stage 8 (Nuclei): pass `-H "Cookie: {session}"` as header override
7. UI: show "Authenticated Scan" badge, warn if auth fails before scan begins

### #15 — Executive Report Generation with LLM Narrative

**What:**
After scan completes, generate a complete professional pentest report with LLM-written narrative:
- **Executive Summary**: business-language risk overview, 3-5 key findings, recommended immediate actions
- **Technical Findings**: one section per Nuclei finding — description, evidence (request/response), CVSS, EPSS, business impact, remediation steps
- **Risk Matrix**: scatter plot of CVSS vs. EPSS for all findings
- **Remediation Roadmap**: prioritized action items ordered by risk_score
- Export to PDF (via chromedp) and Markdown

**Why it matters:**
Writing pentest reports takes 40–60% of a consultant's time. Dradis and PlexTrac charge thousands/month for this. Open-source alternatives are nearly nonexistent. XPFarm currently has zero report generation. This alone would make it commercially valuable.

**Effort:** M (1–2 weeks)

**Implementation in XPFarm:**
1. Create `internal/core/reporter.go`
2. Query all scan data for the asset: findings, CVEs, EPSS scores, risk scores, screenshots
3. Build structured JSON context object (all findings, metadata, asset info)
4. Call LLM API with report generation prompt:
   ```
   You are writing a professional penetration test report.
   Scan data: {JSON dump of all findings, CVEs, assets}
   Write a complete report with: Executive Summary (3 paragraphs, business language),
   Technical Findings (one section each, include HTTP evidence, CVSS, remediation),
   Remediation Roadmap (prioritized table).
   Format as Markdown.
   ```
5. Render Markdown to HTML using `github.com/gomarkdown/markdown`
6. Use `chromedp` to print HTML to PDF: `chromedp.Run(ctx, chromedp.Navigate(url), chromedp.PrintToPDF(&pdf))`
7. Store in `data/reports/{asset_id}_{timestamp}.pdf` and `.md`
8. Add `/api/report/{asset_id}` endpoint + "Download Report" button in UI

---

### QW1: EPSS Score Enrichment (1 day)

**What:** Call `https://api.first.org/data/1.0/epss?cve=CVE-XXXX-XXXX` for every CVE found in Stage 7. Zero cost, no API key required. Sort findings by `cvss * epss_score`.

**Go code:**
```go
type EPSSResponse struct {
    Status string `json:"status"`
    Data   []struct {
        CVE        string  `json:"cve"`
        EPSS       float64 `json:"epss,string"`
        Percentile float64 `json:"percentile,string"`
        Date       string  `json:"date"`
    } `json:"data"`
}

func FetchEPSS(cveID string) (float64, float64, error) {
    resp, err := http.Get("https://api.first.org/data/1.0/epss?cve=" + cveID)
    if err != nil {
        return 0, 0, err
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()
    var result EPSSResponse
    json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&result)
    if len(result.Data) > 0 {
        return result.Data[0].EPSS, result.Data[0].Percentile, nil
    }
    return 0, 0, nil
}
```

**Files to change:** `internal/database/models.go` (+2 fields), `internal/core/manager.go` (call after CVEMap), `internal/ui/templates/findings.html` (show EPSS badge)

---

### QW2: VulnCheck KEV Integration (1 day)

**API:** `GET https://api.vulncheck.com/v3/index/vulncheck-kev?cve=CVE-XXXX-XXXX`
- Header: `Authorization: Bearer {token}` (free at vulncheck.com/api-key)
- Returns: `{"data": [{"cve": "...", "dateAdded": "..."}]}`

**Go SDK:** `go get github.com/vulncheck-oss/sdk-go`

**Files to change:** `internal/database/models.go` (+1 bool field), `internal/core/manager.go` (enrich after CVEMap), template (+KEV badge)

---

### QW3: GreyNoise IP Noise Filtering (1–2 days)

**What:** Before Stage 1, classify all target IPs via GreyNoise. Skip IPs tagged `riot: true` (legitimate business services like AWS health checks that flood scan results). De-prioritize `classification: "benign"` (known scanner bots).

**API:** `GET https://api.greynoise.io/v3/community/{ip}`
- Free tier: unlimited for non-commercial use with key from greynoise.io
- Returns: `{"ip": "...", "noise": bool, "riot": bool, "classification": "benign|malicious|unknown", "name": "..."}`

**Files to change:** New `internal/core/greynoise.go`, `internal/database/models.go` (+classification field), `internal/core/manager.go` (filter before Stage 1)

---

---

### QW5: CISA KEV + EPSS Nuclei Template Targeting (1 day)

**What:** Download CISA KEV JSON feed daily (`https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json`). In Stage 8, automatically add Nuclei templates for any KEV CVEs found by CVEMap. This makes the "smart template plan engine" actually smart about actively-exploited CVEs.

**Files:** Extend existing template plan engine in `internal/core/manager.go`, add CISA KEV polling background goroutine

---

### QW6: OSV.dev Dependency Vulnerability Stage 2.5 (1 day)

**What:** After Httpx detects web frameworks, call `https://api.osv.dev/v1/query` with detected package names/versions. Google's OSV covers Go modules, Python packages, npm, Maven, Cargo.

**API:** `POST https://api.osv.dev/v1/query` with `{"package": {"name": "struts", "ecosystem": "Maven"}, "version": "2.5.30"}`

**Go library:** `go get github.com/google/osv-scanner/pkg/osv`

---

### QW7: Structured SSE Progress Streaming (1–2 days)

**What:** Replace log-based progress with structured `ScanEvent{Stage, Target, Tool, Progress, Message}` SSE stream. Operators see "Katana crawled 450 URLs" in real-time, not just log lines.

**Files:** `internal/core/events.go` (new), `internal/core/manager.go` (emit events), `internal/ui/` (SSE handler), scan progress template

---

**Files:** New `internal/core/reporter.go`, new route + template in `internal/ui/`

---

## Moonshots (Category-Defining)

These would make XPFarm unlike anything else in the open-source space.

---

### MS1: Fully Autonomous "Fire and Forget" Scan Agent

**What:**
A continuous AI agent loop that:
- Monitors target assets 24/7 for changes (new subdomains, new ports, service version changes)
- Prioritizes targets by risk score delta (something changed → immediate rescan)
- Schedules and runs targeted mini-scans autonomously
- Chains exploits when EPSS crosses configurable thresholds
- Generates incident alerts without human intervention
- Operators define scope, rules of engagement, and escalation thresholds once

**Architecture:**
- `SchedulerAgent` goroutine running perpetually
- Prioritized target queue ordered by `last_seen_change + risk_score_delta`
- ReAct loop with reflexion: each cycle, agent reflects on prior findings to choose next target
- Temporal for crash-safe durable execution
- Knowledge graph (SQLite or Neo4j) as persistent memory

**Uniqueness:**
No open-source tool currently combines: continuous monitoring + adaptive AI orchestration + durable crash-safe execution + knowledge graph memory. This is Wiz Red Agent as open source.

**References:**
- Wiz Red Agent: https://www.wiz.io/blog/introducing-the-wiz-red-agent
- PentAGI continuous mode: https://github.com/vxcontrol/pentagi

---

### MS2: Distributed Multi-Node Scan Mesh

**What:**
Transform XPFarm from single-node to distributed scanning network:
- NATS JetStream for event messaging between nodes
- Temporal for workflow coordination
- 2–20 `xpfarm-worker` containers, each running any pipeline stage
- Geographic distribution: scanner nodes in EU + US + APAC simultaneously
- `xpfarm-master` handles API + UI + workflow orchestration
- SQLite → PostgreSQL for multi-writer support

**References:**
- NATS JetStream Go: https://github.com/nats-io/nats.go
- Temporal distributed: https://docs.temporal.io/
- Osmedeus distributed (reference): https://github.com/j3ssie/osmedeus

---

### MS3: Vulnerability Reproduction Sandbox

**What:**
When high-EPSS CVE is found:
1. Pull Docker image for the vulnerable software version
2. Start ephemeral container
3. Run the CVE exploit PoC (from VulnCheck initial-access API)
4. Capture proof: HTTP request that triggered it, system response
5. Attach to finding as "Confirmed Exploitable - PoC attached"
6. Destroy container

CVE-Genie (arXiv:2509.01835) achieves 51% CVE reproduction at $2.77/CVE. Applied to XPFarm's live scan findings, reproduction rates would be significantly higher since the target service is already confirmed running.

**References:**
- CVE-Genie: https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01835v1
- VulnCheck go-exploit: https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit

---

### MS4: BloodHound for External Attack Surface

**What:**
Full external attack graph with path-finding:
- Node types: DNS_RECORD, IP_ADDRESS, PORT, SERVICE, WEB_APP, CVE, CREDENTIAL, INTERNAL_SERVICE
- Edge types: RESOLVES_TO, RUNS_ON, HAS_PORT, HAS_CVE, EXPLOITABLE_WITH, CONNECTS_TO
- Neo4j backend with Cypher path queries: "What is the highest-probability path from internet to database?"
- Interactive Cytoscape.js visualization with animated attack path highlighting
- Risk-weighted shortest path algorithm

BloodHound pioneered this for Active Directory. No equivalent exists for external attack surfaces.

- GraphKer data model: https://github.com/amberzovitis/GraphKer
- Neo4j Go driver: https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver

---

### MS5: AI Security Co-Pilot with Persistent Memory

**What:**
RAG-backed co-pilot that remembers everything across scans:
- "Last time we saw this on a similar target, it was a false positive because the WAF intercepts it"
- "This client always has Log4j exposure on their internal tools — run targeted templates first"
- "This finding pattern matches 3 previous engagements — here's what we found next time"

Uses `go-sqlite-vec` for per-organization vector store. After each human-reviewed finding, embeds finding + verdict + context. Injects as few-shot examples into triage prompts.

This is Semgrep Assistant's memory feature (launched 2025) as open source.

## Competitive Landscape

### Where XPFarm Sits Today

XPFarm is a **best-in-class deterministic scan pipeline** with excellent tool coverage (10+ tools), unified UI, and a clean Go architecture. It's faster to set up than Osmedeus, more comprehensive than basic Nuclei wrappers, and has the beginnings of AI via Overlord.

**Gap vs. category leaders:**

| Tool | Stars | XPFarm's Edge | XPFarm's Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BBOT** | 9.5k | Better UI, Docker-simple, Nuclei integrated | Event-driven recursive, 100+ modules, 20-50% more subdomain discovery |
| **Osmedeus** | 6.2k | Simpler setup, unified UI | Distributed workers, declarative YAML workflows, cloud provisioning |
| **PentAGI** | 13.6k | Simpler architecture, more approachable | AI orchestration, knowledge graph, multi-LLM |
| **PentestGPT** | 12.2k | Actual scanning (vs. guidance only) | Conversational interface, CTF-proven AI reasoning |
| **Nuclei** | 22k | More tools, UI | Template coverage, community, speed |
| **ProjectDiscovery suite** | Various | Unified experience | Individual tool depth |

### The Unique Combination Available to XPFarm

No single open-source tool combines:
1. Deterministic 8-stage pipeline (XPFarm already has this)
2. LLM false-positive triage (nobody has this open-source)
3. EPSS/VulnCheck risk scoring (simple API calls)
4. Passive enrichment pre-stage (uncover library exists)
5. Visual attack graph (Cytoscape.js + SQLite graph tables)
6. AI screenshot analysis (GPT-4o vision API)
7. Chat-driven control (conversational interface)

**That stack does not exist in any single tool today.** PentAGI comes closest but lacks XPFarm's unified tool pipeline and clean UI. BBOT has better discovery but no AI triage. Osmedeus has better orchestration but no AI reasoning.

## Implementation Step-by-Steps

### Step-by-Step: EPSS + VulnCheck KEV (Recommended First)

**Estimated time: 1–2 days**
**Files:** `internal/database/models.go`, `internal/core/enrichment.go` (new), `internal/core/manager.go`, `internal/ui/templates/`

**Step 1: Update CVE model**
```go
// internal/database/models.go
type CVE struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    EpssScore      float64 `json:"epss_score" gorm:"default:0"`
    EpssPercentile float64 `json:"epss_percentile" gorm:"default:0"`
    InCisaKev      bool    `json:"in_cisa_kev" gorm:"default:false"`
    InVulncheckKev bool    `json:"in_vulncheck_kev" gorm:"default:false"`
    RiskScore      float64 `json:"risk_score" gorm:"default:0"`
}
```

**Step 2: Create enrichment.go**
```go
// internal/core/enrichment.go
package core

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "time"
)

var epssClient = &http.Client{Timeout: 10 * time.Second}

func FetchEPSS(cveID string) (score, percentile float64, err error) {
    url := fmt.Sprintf("https://api.first.org/data/1.0/epss?cve=%s", cveID)
    resp, err := epssClient.Get(url)
    if err != nil {
        return 0, 0, err
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()
    var result struct {
        Data []struct {
            EPSS       string `json:"epss"`
            Percentile string `json:"percentile"`
        } `json:"data"`
    }
    if err := json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&result); err != nil {
        return 0, 0, err
    }
    if len(result.Data) > 0 {
        fmt.Sscanf(result.Data[0].EPSS, "%f", &score)
        fmt.Sscanf(result.Data[0].Percentile, "%f", &percentile)
    }
    return score, percentile, nil
}

func ComputeRiskScore(cvssScore, epssScore float64, inKev bool) float64 {
    risk := cvssScore * (epssScore + 0.01) // epss avoids zero multiplication
    if inKev {
        risk *= 3.0 // KEV multiplier
    }
    return risk
}
```

**Step 3: Wire into Stage 7 of manager.go**
```go
// In runCVEMapScan or equivalent in manager.go
// After saving each CVE to DB:
epss, percentile, _ := FetchEPSS(cve.CVEID)
inKev := checkCISAKev(cve.CVEID) // download feed once, cache in memory
risk := ComputeRiskScore(cve.CVSSScore, epss, inKev)
db.Model(&cve).Updates(map[string]interface{}{
    "epss_score": epss,
    "epss_percentile": percentile,
    "in_cisa_kev": inKev,
    "risk_score": risk,
})
```

**Step 4: Add CISA KEV feed caching**
```go
var cisaKevCache = map[string]bool{}
var cisaKevLoaded time.Time

func loadCISAKev() {
    if time.Since(cisaKevLoaded) < 24*time.Hour {
        return
    }
    resp, _ := http.Get("https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json")
    defer resp.Body.Close()
    var feed struct {
        Vulnerabilities []struct {
            CVEID string `json:"cveID"`
        } `json:"vulnerabilities"`
    }
    json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&feed)
    cisaKevCache = map[string]bool{}
    for _, v := range feed.Vulnerabilities {
        cisaKevCache[v.CVEID] = true
    }
    cisaKevLoaded = time.Now()
}
```

**Step 5: Update Findings UI template**
```html
{{if gt .EpssScore 0.0}}
<span class="badge epss-badge"
      style="background: {{if gt .EpssPercentile 0.7}}#ff4444{{else if gt .EpssPercentile 0.3}}#ff8800{{else}}#888888{{end}}">
    EPSS {{printf "%.1f" (mul .EpssScore 100)}}%
</span>
{{end}}
{{if .InCisaKev}}
<span class="badge" style="background:#cc0000; color:white;">KEV</span>
{{end}}
```

### Step-by-Step: Screenshot Vision Analysis

**Estimated time: 2 days**
**Files:** `internal/core/vision.go` (new), `internal/database/models.go`, `internal/core/manager.go`, UI template

**Step 1: Add fields to WebAsset model**
```go
type WebAsset struct {
    // ... existing ...
    ScreenshotTags     string `json:"screenshot_tags"`     // JSON array
    ScreenshotAnalysis string `json:"screenshot_analysis"` // LLM summary
    ScreenshotAnalyzed bool   `json:"screenshot_analyzed"`
}
```

**Step 2: Create vision.go**
```go
// internal/core/vision.go
package core

import (
    "bytes"
    "encoding/base64"
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"

    SensitiveData      bool     `json:"sensitive_data_visible"`
    SensitiveDetails   string   `json:"sensitive_data_details"`
    InterestingSurface string   `json:"interesting_surface"`
    Tags               []string `json:"tags"`
}

func AnalyzeScreenshot(screenshotPath, apiKey string) (*ScreenshotInsights, error) {
    imgData, err := os.ReadFile(screenshotPath)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    b64 := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(imgData)

    prompt := `Analyze this web interface screenshot from a security researcher's perspective.
Return JSON only: {

  "interesting_surface": "one sentence summary of attack interest",
  "tags": ["login", "admin", "dashboard", "grafana", "jenkins", "debug", "error", "default-creds", etc]
}`

    reqBody, _ := json.Marshal(map[string]interface{}{
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "messages": []map[string]interface{}{
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": []map[string]interface{}{
                    {"type": "image_url", "image_url": map[string]string{"url": "data:image/png;base64," + b64}},
                    {"type": "text", "text": prompt},
                },
            },
        },
        "max_tokens": 500,
    })

    req, _ := http.NewRequest("POST", "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", bytes.NewReader(reqBody))
    req.Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer "+apiKey)
    req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")

    resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    var result struct {
        Choices []struct {
            Message struct {
                Content string `json:"content"`
            } `json:"message"`
        } `json:"choices"`
    }
    json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&result)

    if len(result.Choices) == 0 {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("no response from vision API")
    }

    var insights ScreenshotInsights
    json.Unmarshal([]byte(result.Choices[0].Message.Content), &insights)
    return &insights, nil
}
```

**Step 3: Wire into manager.go after Stage 6 (Gowitness)**
```go
// After gowitness stage completes, iterate web assets
apiKey := getSettingOrEnv(db, "openai_api_key", "OPENAI_API_KEY")
if apiKey != "" {
    var webAssets []database.WebAsset
    db.Where("asset_id = ? AND screenshot_path != '' AND screenshot_analyzed = false", assetID).Find(&webAssets)
    for _, wa := range webAssets {
        insights, err := AnalyzeScreenshot(wa.ScreenshotPath, apiKey)
        if err == nil {
            tagsJSON, _ := json.Marshal(insights.Tags)
            db.Model(&wa).Updates(map[string]interface{}{
                "screenshot_tags": string(tagsJSON),
                "screenshot_analysis": insights.InterestingSurface,
                "screenshot_analyzed": true,
            })
        }
        time.Sleep(200 * time.Millisecond) // rate limit
    }
}
```

    s := server.NewMCPServer(
        "XPFarm Security Scanner",
        "1.0.0",
        server.WithToolCapabilities(true),
    )

    s.AddTool(mcp.NewTool("subfinder",
        mcp.WithDescription("Enumerate subdomains for a target domain"),
        mcp.WithString("domain", mcp.Required(), mcp.Description("Target domain to enumerate")),
    ), func(ctx context.Context, req mcp.CallToolRequest) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error) {
        domain := req.Params.Arguments["domain"].(string)
        output, err := modules["subfinder"].Run(ctx, domain)
        if err != nil {
            return mcp.NewToolResultError(err.Error()), nil
        }
        return mcp.NewToolResultText(output), nil
